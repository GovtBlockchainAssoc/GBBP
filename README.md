# GBBP
This is the key coordination point for the Government Business Blockchain Platform.  If you have a technical issue with the GBBP platform or any of its components, and can't figure out exactly where your ticket belongs, you can post it here and we will move it to the appropriate location. 

There is no code here since it is all distributed out to the repos listed below.  The smart contract & DApp developer Kanban boards for the core PoA Ethereum blockchain will reside here under the Projects tab.

Documentation 
  * https://github.com/GovtBlockchainAssoc/DraftDocs - Home of the draft documentation Word documents and wiki pages.  The documentation creators Kanban board resides on the Draft Documents Projects tab.
  * https://github.com/GovtBlockchainAssoc/GBBP/tree/master/Docs - Home of the current, finalized documentation

Smart Contracts - Smart contracts for each blockchain that has them.  Note that all smart contracts for a given blockchain can easily be stored in the base directory of the repo.
 * Ethereum (https://github.com/GovtBlockchainAssoc/EthereumContracts)
  
DApp Repos (including Gateways) - Each DApp should have a separate repository.  The smart contract & DApp developer Kanban boards for each linked blockchain will reside on that blockchain's gateway repo and the README.md will maintain pointers to all developer repos for that blockchain.
